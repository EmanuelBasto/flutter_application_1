# 🚀Login Animado con Flutter + Rive


Project developed by Emmanuel Basto, where we explore the use of Flutter along with a **state machine** to handle app logic in a clean, predictable, and scalable way.

It’s a simple yet powerful app that serves as a foundation for larger projects or as an educational demo to understand state-driven UIs.

---

## What’s it about?

This application demonstrates how a **state machine** can control the flow of an app by defining clear states and transitions:

- Moves smoothly between screens based on user actions 
- Ensures predictable behavior across the app ⚙
- Easy to extend with new states and logic

---

##  Features

- **Login system** with input validation 
- **Interactive UI** that responds to state changes in real-time  
- **Error handling** for invalid actions 
- **Scalable structure** for adding more screens and business logic  

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- Flutter and Dart for app development  
- **State Machine pattern** for handling app logic  
- Visual Studio Code as the development environment  
- Android Studio for emulation and testing

## 📁 Project Structure  

/lib  
 ├── main.dart              # App entry point  
 └── screens/  
     └── login_screen.dart  # Login screen with animation logic  
/assets  
 └── animated_login_character.riv  # Rive animation file  

*Brief explanation:*  
- **main.dart** → Starts the Flutter app and routes to login screen  
- **login_screen.dart** → Handles UI, user input, and controls the Rive State Machine  
- **.riv file** → Contains the polar bear animation and state machine logic  

---
## Final note

This project is designed as a starting point for building more complete Flutter applications.
It can be easily expanded with new screens, business logic, or external service integrations.
